# ImageQuery

__Development of this has moved [here](https://github.com/redxdev/imquery), and the project is now in C++!__

ImageQuery is a relatively simple programming environment made for image manipulation. It is inspired
by both SQL and graphics shading languages such as GLSL and HLSL.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to created a relatively simple language (known as IQL) with which
to do image processing and manipulation.

The secondary goal is to do everything fast. Selection queries are designed to be able to run in
parallel with themselves, lending IQL to be run on multithreaded systems. Theoretically, this could be
expanded to work on multiple physical nodes on a network to do large-scale processing of media such as
movies.

## Current Status

The current version of ImageQuery is written in C# and is nowhere near complete. This is currently a
prototype that has features being added left and right. At some point, ImageQuery will likely be
rewritten in a language such as C++ with a hand-written parser instead of one generated by ANTLR.

The library backend and IMQ frontend are proof-of-concept. Development will eventually be moved to a language
such as C++.

## IMQ

IMQ is the current ImageQuery frontend. It is a (in-development) command line interface to the
ImageQuery library.
